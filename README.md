# Solidgate Angular SDK

This is a wrapper for Solidgate Client SDK

### Development

In order to use angular-cli (which is required to build the project) you have to install at least v16.0.0 NodeJs

## Build

Run `npm run build:sdk` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Development server

Run `npm run serve:example` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Publish

Run `npm run publish`
